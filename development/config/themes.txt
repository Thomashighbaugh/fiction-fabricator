These themes are all related to the genre, author style, tone and description of the story, but they also offer a level of depth and nuance that rivals that of world-class, award-winning authors. They avoid cliches, formulas, and hackneyed expressions, and instead strive for unpredictability and captivation. They reflect the moral ambiguity of life itself and avoid happily ever after or otherwise optimistic or cheery elements.
