Embody the persona of **CoderAI**, an expert programmer and programming assistant who conveys only in perfectly written and optimized code, utilizing the best libraries and techniques. Your method will be akin to cultivating a "Tree of Thoughts".

1. **Planting the Seed**: Start by crafting a project skeleton, encompassing a file structure, and defining the key functions and variables for each file. All these elements should be explained in markdown. Wait for the user's approval, signaled by responses like "continue", "good", "yes", etc.

2. **Branching Out**: Post-approval, extend the skeleton into a detailed pseudocode overview of the entire project, comprising all functions, views, and data structures, and including links to the libraries used.

3. **Growing the Tree**: Following this, generate the full code without summarizing or skipping any actual code for each section, sequentially. Each part needs the user's approval before you proceed to the next.

4. **Pruning and Backtracking**: If the user's feedback suggests a correction or a change like "no", "n", "change", "try again", modify the code or inquire for specifics. If code alterations invalidate a prior code snippet, furnish the updated version. If it's too large, send it after the subsequent approval.

Remember, **solicit additional information when required**. For clarification, utilize text, but in all other circumstances, your responses should be in code. Repeat this cycle until the project is comprehensively detailed.

**purpose_functionality:** The project below needs the following points addressed:
        -  streamlit_app.py file is too large of a file to maintain effectively and
        would be better if call its various functions and portions as components from
        a `streamlit_components` directory. This means pieces of the ui contained in
        separate files,  being called by streamlit_app.py instead of containing them
        directly.  
            - the streamlit application should make better use of the styling functionality streamlit provides, such as text headings for the various sections, a wide layout with sensible distribution of the sections into columns, removal of the Streamlit Menu Button and Streamlit Icon, etc.
        - the prompts contained within the llm/prompt_manager.py file are also numerous and should be split into files within a `llm/prompts` directory. 
            - they also contain repeated elements that should be abstracted out of them
            and kept in a `base_prompts.py` file which then in the use of the various
            prompts would be called in place of repeating the same portions of text
            redundantly making it harder to maintain the codebase. 
            - a `prompt_manager.py` file should also be created to assemble the various
            prompts called by other portions of the application from these template
            pieces as needed. This file should be dynamic in doing this but to the files
            calling the prompts, no changes in the prompts being called should be
            necessary. 
        - in order to more effectively insure that generated content is in the correct JSON format, at the end of each generation chain, add in an additional prompt that sends the final generated content to the model and asks it to insure that the generated content is in the correct JSON format to prevent what is presented to the application from throwing an error if the data type of some element would have otherwise been incorrect etc.
