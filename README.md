# Fiction Fabricator

![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.10+-blue.svg)

Fiction Fabricator is an advanced, AI-powered framework for generating complete, multi-chapter novels from a single creative prompt. It leverages a suite of modern Language Learning Models (LLMs) through a unified interface, employing a sophisticated, multi-stage pipeline of outlining, scene-by-scene generation, and iterative revision to produce high-quality, coherent long-form narratives.

## Acknowledgement of Origin

This project is a significantly modified and enhanced fork of **[AIStoryteller by datacrystals](https://github.com/datacrystals/AIStoryteller)**. I would like to expressing extend my immense gratitude to the original author for providing the foundational concepts and architecture. Fiction Fabricator builds upon that excellent groundwork with new features, a refactored generation pipeline, and a robust, multi-provider backend to suit a different set of use cases focused on flexibility, quality, and developer control.
