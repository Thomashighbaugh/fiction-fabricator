# streamlit_app/__init__.py

"""
Package initializer for the streamlit_app package.

This package contains all the modules and components for the Streamlit
web application of the Fiction Fabricator. It is responsible for:

- app.py: The main script for running the Streamlit application. 
  This file sets up the user interface, manages application state, 
  and orchestrates the content generation workflow.
- components/: A directory intended to house reusable Streamlit 
  components. While currently minimally used, this structure is in 
  place for future expansion and organization of UI elements. 

The streamlit_app package is the primary user interface for the 
Fiction Fabricator, providing an interactive and visual way for users 
to create and refine their fictional content.
