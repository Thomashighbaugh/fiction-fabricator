# streamlit_app/components/__init__.py

"""
Package initializer for the streamlit_app.components package.

This package is intended to house reusable Streamlit components 
for the Fiction Fabricator application. 

Currently, it is minimally populated as the application's UI 
is primarily managed within app.py. However, this package is 
structured to facilitate future expansion and organization 
of UI elements into reusable components, should the complexity 
of the application grow.

As the application evolves, specific UI components like custom 
input forms, display panels, or interactive elements can be 
modularized and placed within this package to improve code 
organization and maintainability of the Streamlit application.
