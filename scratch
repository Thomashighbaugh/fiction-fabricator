    Semantic Storage: Use embeddings to create a semantic representation of key parts of the text:

        Story Specification

        Act/Chapter Summaries

        Key Scenes

        Character Descriptions

        Thematic Statements

    Retrieval: When the LLM needs context, use embeddings to retrieve relevant snippets from storage. You can use cosine similarity to find the most similar stored content to the current prompt.

    Prompt Augmentation: Inject the retrieved snippets into the prompt to provide extra context to the LLM.

    Incremental Update: Update embeddings incrementally as the story evolves.

    Vector Databases: Use vector databases to store and retrieve embeddings efficiently.

3. Explicit "World Model"

    Data Structures: Maintain a structured data representation of the story:

        Characters (with detailed profiles, relationships, and motivations).

        Locations (with descriptions and significance).

        Key Objects (with descriptions and history).

        Timeline (of important events).

        Themes (list of recurring ideas and motifs).

    LLM as Manager: Use the LLM to manage this model. For example, after a major scene, have the LLM update relevant character profiles, the timeline, or other elements of the model.

    Context Injection: Selectively inject parts of this world model into prompts to provide essential context for each step of the writing process.

4. Prompt Engineering for Human-Like Text:

    Persona: The system prompt does an okay job of this, and should be expanded upon.

    Show, Don't Tell: Encourage the LLM to use sensory language, actions, and dialogue, rather than just stating facts.

    Vary Sentence Structure: Prompt the LLM to vary sentence lengths, use transitions, and create a natural flow.

    Emotional Range: Instruct the LLM to generate text with a full range of emotions appropriate to the scene.

    Character Voice: Be very clear in your prompt that the LLM should be consistent in how each character speaks and acts.

    Literary Devices: Add instruction to use metaphors, similes, and other literary devices.

5. Implementation Details

    Modular Design: Break the code into modules that handle different tasks:

        Embedding generation/retrieval.

        World model management.

        Prompt construction.

        LLM interaction.

    Caching: Implement caching to avoid repeated calls for the same information (this is done already using joblib).

    Error Handling: Ensure robust error handling at each stage, with detailed logging for debugging.
