Refactoring Principles:

    Single Responsibility Principle: Ensure each function and class has one clear purpose.

    DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself): Avoid redundant code and reuse functions or classes where possible.

    Readability: Keep your code clean, well-commented, and understandable.

    Modularity: Design your components so they can be easily modified and reused.
