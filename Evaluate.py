Please evaluate which outlines are better from the following two outlines:

Here's the first outline:
<OutlineA>
{_Outline1}
</OutlineA>

And here is the second outline:
<OutlineB>
{_Outline2}
</OutlineB>

Use the following criteria to evaluate (NOTE: You'll be picking outline A or outline B later on for these criteria):
- Plot: Does the story have a coherent plot? Is It creative?
- Chapters: Do the chapters flow into each-other (be very careful when checking this)? Do they feel connected? Do they feel homogenized or are they unique and fresh?
- Style: Does the writing style help move the plot or is it distracting from the rest of the story? Is it excessively flowery?
- Dialogue: Is the dialog specific to each character? Does it feel in-character? Is there enough or too little?
- Tropes: Do the tropes make sense for the genre? Are they interesting and well integrated?
- Genre: Is the genre clear?
- Narrative Structure: Is it clear what the structure is? Does it fit with the genre/tropes/content?

Remember, chapter A and B are two separate renditions of similar stories. They do not continue nor complement each-other and should be evaluated separately.

Emphasize Chapter A and B as you rate the result.
