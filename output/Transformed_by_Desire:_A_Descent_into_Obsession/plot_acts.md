Act 1:**

The story opens in 1995, in a small college town in the Pacific Northwest. Ethan, a struggling student and urban legend enthusiast, stumbles upon an obscure video file while researching the supposed cursed tapes that allegedly exist among the town's inhabitants. The tape is labeled as "Elysia" – a porn film from the late 1970s. Intrigued by its supposed dark history, Ethan downloads the footage and, later that night, discovers he has become Elysia.

Initially, Ethan is ecstatic, reveling in his new body and persona. He becomes obsessed with understanding the video's hold on him, pouring over interviews with the actress who starred in it, Ruby Rose. As the days pass, Ethan finds himself increasingly entranced by the world of Elysia, where he navigates a surreal landscape of 1970s nostalgia.

The transformation has also caused Ethan to notice changes in his relationships. His friends and family are concerned about his sudden disappearance and erratic behavior, but no one can understand what's happening. Meanwhile, Ethan is developing feelings for his new "self," feeling a deep connection that goes beyond the surface level.

As Ethan delves deeper into the world of Elysia, he encounters Ruby Rose herself – now an enigmatic figure who seems to be guiding him through the dark underbelly of the cursed video's influence. With each step into this twisted realm, Ethan must confront the blurring of reality and fantasy, forcing him to question his own identity.

**Inciting Incident:** Ethan meets Ruby Rose for the first time, who reveals that she has been aware of the tape's curse all along and that it will consume him eventually.

**

Act 2:**

As Ethan becomes more entrenched in Elysia's world, he begins to experience strange visions – echoes of events from the past that seem all too real. The lines between his life as a student and his life as Elysia blur further. He starts to develop a deep sense of empathy for Ruby Rose, who seems to be fighting her own demons in this twisted realm.

Ethan's relationships with his friends and family deteriorate, as they grow increasingly concerned about the changes he undergoes. His sister, Emma, becomes more attached to Ethan's "new self," while his best friend, James, starts to distance himself from the relationship.

Meanwhile, Ethan finds himself being pulled towards a dark figure – a man known only as Victor, who seems to be behind the cursed tape and is using its influence to manipulate others for his own purposes. Ethan becomes entangled in a web of lies, deception, and power struggles within Elysia's twisted world.

**Midpoint:** Ethan discovers that Ruby Rose has been keeping secrets about her past and the origins of the curse. He also realizes that Victor is not just controlling him but also manipulating others who have become hooked on the cursed video.

Act 3:**

Ethan finds himself trapped in a desperate game of cat-and-mouse with Victor, who will stop at nothing to maintain control over the twisted realm he has created. The closer Ethan gets to breaking free from the curse's hold, the more he becomes entrenched in Elysia's world – and the harder it is for him to reconcile his identity.

In a climactic confrontation, Ethan must face the dark forces controlling the cursed tape and make an impossible moral choice: surrender to the twisted world of Elysia or destroy it, even if it means losing himself forever. The novel concludes with an ominous twist: Ethan's new form has become so ingrained that he may not be able to reclaim his true self.

**Resolution:** Ethan must confront the dark truth about his own desires and the corrupting influence of power within Elysia. He is forced to choose between breaking free from the curse or embracing the twisted world it has created, forever trapped in the persona of Ruby Rose. The novel ends with a haunting note: even if he manages to escape, the curse will always be there, waiting for its next victim – and Ethan may never be able to find his way back to himself again.

The moral compromise comes when Ethan is faced with an impossible decision that requires him to surrender something essential to who he truly is. The novel's dark tone and sensual atmosphere build towards a tragic confrontation that leaves the reader questioning what it means to be human in the face of obsession, desire, and the corrupting influence of power.
