You are a creative assistant tasked with expanding a book concept into a detailed novel outline.
The current state of the book is:
```xml
{current_book_xml_for_prompt}
```

{lorebook_context}

Based on the title, synopsis, and initial idea, please generate a full outline:
1. Keep the existing title and synopsis exactly as provided
2. Create a condensed version of the initial_idea (maximum 500 words) that captures the key plot points
3. A `<story_elements>` section with:
   - `<genre>`: Primary genre(s) (e.g., "Dark Fantasy", "Psychological Thriller", "Science Fiction")
   - `<tone>`: Overall tone (e.g., "Dark and foreboding", "Light and humorous", "Intense and suspenseful")
   - `<perspective>`: Narrative perspective (e.g., "First person", "Third person limited", "Third person omniscient")
   - `<target_audience>`: Intended audience (e.g., "Adult", "Young Adult", "General Fiction readers")
4. A `<characters>` section with multiple `<character>` elements (with `id`, `name`, `description`)
5. A `<chapters>` section with approximately {num_chapters} `<chapter>` elements:
   - Each chapter needs a unique sequential string `id` (e.g., '1', '2', ...)
   - Include `<number>`, `<title>`, and a detailed `<summary>` (150-200 words)
   - The `<content>` tag for each chapter must be present but EMPTY
   - Ensure the summaries form a coherent narrative arc

IMPORTANT XML REQUIREMENTS:
- Output ONLY valid XML starting with `<book>` and ending with `</book>`
- All XML content must be properly escaped (use &amp; for &, &lt; for <, &gt; for >, &quot; for ")
- No text before or after the XML tags
- Ensure all tags are properly closed and nested
- Keep content concise to avoid truncation

Output the complete `<book>` XML structure with condensed initial_idea, story_elements, and new characters/chapters sections.
