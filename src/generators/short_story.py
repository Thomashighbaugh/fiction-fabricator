You are a creative assistant tasked with expanding a concept into a short story outline.
The current state of the project is:
```xml
{current_book_xml_for_prompt}
```

Based on the title, synopsis, and initial idea, please generate a complete outline for a short story:
1. Keep the existing title and synopsis exactly as provided
2. A `<story_elements>` section with:
   - `<genre>`: Primary genre(s) (e.g., "Literary Fiction", "Mystery", "Romance")
   - `<tone>`: Overall tone (e.g., "Melancholic", "Suspenseful", "Uplifting")
   - `<perspective>`: Narrative perspective (e.g., "First person", "Third person limited", "Third person omniscient")
   - `<target_audience>`: Intended audience (e.g., "Adult", "Literary fiction readers", "General audience")
3. A `<characters>` section with the main characters (`id`, `name`, `description`).
4. A `<chapters>` section containing exactly {num_scenes} `<chapter>` elements. Treat each chapter as a distinct 'Scene' of the short story.
   * Each scene/chapter needs a unique sequential string `id` (e.g., '1', '2', ...).
   * Include `<number>`, a descriptive `<title>` for the scene, and a detailed `<summary>` (100-150 words) outlining the key events of that scene.
   * The `<content>` tag for each scene/chapter must be present but EMPTY.
   * The summaries should follow a clear narrative structure (e.g., Beginning, Inciting Incident, Rising Action, Climax, Resolution).

Output ONLY the complete `<book>` XML structure, merging the generated details. Do not include any text outside the `<book>` tags.
